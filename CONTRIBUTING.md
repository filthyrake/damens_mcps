## Code of Conduct

### Our Standards

- **Be respectful and inclusive** of differing viewpoints and experiences
- **Provide constructive feedback** and be open to receiving it
- **Focus on what's best** for the community and the projects
- **Show empathy** towards other community members
- **Collaborate openly** and transparently

### Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, discriminatory comments, or personal attacks
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, or spam
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** for all projects
- **Git** for version control
- **Virtual environment** knowledge (required for all Python development)
- **Network access** to infrastructure systems for testing
- **API credentials** for the platforms you want to work with

### Finding Issues to Work On

1. Browse the [issue tracker](../../issues) for open issues
2. Look for labels:
   - `good-first-issue` - Great for newcomers
   - `help-wanted` - Contributions especially welcome
   - `bug` - Bug fixes needed
   - `enhancement` - New features or improvements
3. Check individual project directories for project-specific issues
4. Feel free to propose new features by opening an issue first

```

Each project has its own:
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Project-specific contribution guidelines
- `SECURITY.md` - Project-specific security considerations
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `tests/` - Test suite
- `examples/` - Usage examples

## Contributing to Multiple Projects

### Single Project Contributions

If you're contributing to just one project:

1. Navigate to the project directory (e.g., `cd pfsense-mcp`)
2. Read that project's `CONTRIBUTING.md` for specific guidelines
3. Follow the project-specific development workflow
4. Test changes within that project's context

### Multi-Project Contributions

If your contribution affects multiple projects:

1. **Documentation Changes**: Update all affected project READMEs
2. **Common Patterns**: Ensure consistency across projects
3. **Testing**: Test changes in each affected project
4. **Coordination**: Mention all affected projects in your PR

### Cross-Project Best Practices

- **Consistency**: Follow similar patterns across projects where possible
- **Documentation**: Keep documentation synchronized
- **Testing**: Maintain similar test coverage standards
- **Security**: Apply security best practices uniformly

## Development Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/damens_mcps.git
cd damens_mcps
```

### 2. Choose Your Project

```bash
# Navigate to the project you want to work on
cd pfsense-mcp    # or truenas-mcp, idrac-mcp, proxmox-mcp
```

### 3. Set Up Virtual Environment

**ALWAYS use virtual environments** - never install packages globally:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate it
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-asyncio pytest-mock
```

### 4. Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy example configuration
cp env.example .env  # or config.example.json to config.json

# Edit with your credentials (never commit these!)
nano .env
```

### 5. Verify Setup

```bash
# Run tests to verify setup
pytest tests/ -v

# Try running the server
python -m src.server  # Command varies by project
```

## Coding Standards

All projects follow these standards:

### Python Style

- **PEP 8** compliance with 100-character line length
- **Type hints** required for all function signatures
- **Docstrings** required for all public APIs (Google-style)
- **Naming conventions**:
  - Functions/methods: `snake_case`
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
  - Private methods: `_leading_underscore`

### Code Quality Tools

```bash
# Format code (if you have these installed)
black src/ --line-length 100
isort src/

# Check style
flake8 src/ --max-line-length=100

# Type checking
mypy src/
```

### Security Requirements

- **Input validation** for all user inputs
- **No hardcoded credentials** in code
- **Parameterized queries** to prevent injection
- **Error messages** should not expose sensitive information
- **Use HTTPS** for all API communications

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

- **All new features** must include tests
- **Bug fixes** should include regression tests
- **Aim for 80%+ coverage** on new code
- **Test edge cases** and error conditions

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests for a project
cd <project-name>
pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_validation.py -v
```

### Test Organization

```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ test_client.py          # API client tests
â”œâ”€â”€ test_server.py          # MCP server tests
â”œâ”€â”€ test_validation.py      # Input validation tests
â””â”€â”€ conftest.py             # Shared fixtures
```

### CI/CD

All tests run automatically on:
- Every push to the repository
- Every pull request
- Tests must pass before merging

## Pull Request Process

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:

- `feature/add-<feature-name>` - New features
- `fix/<bug-description>` - Bug fixes
- `docs/<what-changed>` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/<what-refactored>` - Code refactoring
- `test/<what-tested>` - Test additions

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Formatting, no code change
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(pfsense): add firewall rule grouping support

Implements firewall rule group management with create, update,
and delete operations. Groups help organize related rules.

Closes #123
```

### PR Template

When you create a PR, fill out the template with:
- Description of changes
- Motivation and context
- Type of change (bug fix, feature, etc.)
- Testing performed
- Checklist completion

### Review Process

1. **Automated checks** run first (tests, linting)
2. **Maintainer review** of code and approach
3. **Feedback and iteration** as needed
4. **Approval and merge** when ready

## Security

### Security First

- **Never commit credentials** (use `.gitignore`)
- **Validate all inputs** before processing
- **Report vulnerabilities** privately (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md))
- **Follow security best practices** in each project's SECURITY.md

### Reporting Security Issues

**Do NOT open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead:
1. Review our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md)
2. Report vulnerabilities privately as described there
3. Allow time for fixes before public disclosure

## Project-Specific Guidelines

Each project has additional specific guidelines in its own `CONTRIBUTING.md`:

- **[pfSense MCP](pfsense-mcp/CONTRIBUTING.md)** - Firewall management specifics
- **[TrueNAS MCP](truenas-mcp/CONTRIBUTING.md)** - Storage management specifics
- **[iDRAC MCP](idrac-mcp/CONTRIBUTING.md)** - Server management specifics
- **[Proxmox MCP](proxmox-mcp/CONTRIBUTING.md)** - Virtualization specifics

**Always read the project-specific CONTRIBUTING.md** for the project you're working on.
