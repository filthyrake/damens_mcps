## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

When contributing code:

- **Validate all inputs** before processing
- **Use whitelist approaches** for validation (allow known-good, not block known-bad)
- **Never hardcode credentials** or secrets
- **Use parameterized queries** to prevent injection attacks
- **Sanitize error messages** to avoid information leakage
- **Follow least privilege principle** in all designs
- **Review project-specific SECURITY.md** files

### For Users/Deployers

When deploying these MCP servers:

#### 1. Credential Management

**Use API keys instead of passwords:**
```bash
# Good
PLATFORM_API_KEY=your-secure-api-key

# Less secure
PLATFORM_USERNAME=admin
PLATFORM_PASSWORD=password123
```

**Secure credential storage:**
- Use environment variables (`.env` files not in git)
- Set file permissions: `chmod 600 .env config.json`
- Consider secret management systems (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Rotate credentials regularly (quarterly minimum)

#### 2. Network Security

**Isolate management networks:**
- Place MCP servers on dedicated management VLANs
- Restrict access with firewall rules
- Use VPN for remote access
- Implement network segmentation

**Use HTTPS/TLS:**
```bash
# Production (always!)
SSL_VERIFY=true

# Development only (never in production!)
SSL_VERIFY=false
```

#### 3. Access Control

**Principle of least privilege:**
- Create dedicated service accounts for MCP servers
- Grant only required permissions
- Avoid using default admin accounts
- Enable multi-factor authentication where possible
- Regularly audit access permissions

#### 4. Monitoring & Logging

**Enable comprehensive logging:**
- Log all authentication attempts
- Monitor for failed login attempts
- Track configuration changes
- Set up alerts for suspicious activity
- Forward logs to centralized SIEM

**What to monitor:**
- Failed authentication (threshold: 5 in 5 minutes)
- Unauthorized API access attempts
- Configuration changes
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Service restarts or disruptions

#### 5. Updates & Patching

**Keep everything updated:**
```bash
# Update Python dependencies regularly
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Check for security issues
pip install safety
safety check

# Update the MCP server code
git pull
```

**Update schedule:**
- **Critical security patches:** Within 24 hours
- **Important updates:** Within 1 week
- **Regular updates:** Monthly
- **Dependency updates:** Quarterly

## Known Security Considerations

### Authentication

- API keys/tokens are transmitted with each request (HTTPS required)
- No built-in rate limiting (implement at network/proxy level)
- Session management depends on underlying platform APIs

### Authorization

- MCP servers inherit the permissions of their API credentials
- Granular permission control depends on platform capabilities
- No built-in role-based access control in MCP layer

### Data Storage

- Credentials stored in plaintext in `.env` or `config.json` files
  - **Critical:** Set proper file permissions (`chmod 600`)
  - **Better:** Use external secret management systems
- No built-in encryption for configuration files
- Consider encrypted volumes for production deployments

### Network Communications

- All API calls go over network to target platforms
- HTTPS/TLS required for production (prevents MITM attacks)
- No built-in request signing or additional authentication layers

## Security Features by Project

## Recent Security Improvements

### Input Validation Enhancement (2024-10)

- **pfSense**: Command injection prevention for package/service operations
- **TrueNAS**: Path traversal protection for ID-based operations
- **iDRAC**: VMID and node name validation
- **Proxmox**: Enhanced validation for VM/container operations

See: [SECURITY_SUMMARY.md](SECURITY_SUMMARY.md) for details.

### CodeQL Security Scanning

All projects are scanned with CodeQL for:
- Command injection vulnerabilities
- Path traversal issues
- SQL injection risks
- Credential exposure
- Other common vulnerabilities

Current status: ‚úÖ **0 known vulnerabilities**

## Compliance Considerations

### Regulatory Frameworks

If your deployment must comply with regulations:

**PCI DSS:**
- Encrypt transmission (HTTPS/TLS)
- Restrict access (network segmentation, firewall rules)
- Maintain audit trails (comprehensive logging)
- Regular security testing (penetration tests)

**HIPAA:**
- Access controls (MFA, least privilege)
- Encryption in transit (SSL/TLS)
- Audit logging (centralized logging)
- Breach notification procedures

**GDPR:**
- Data protection (encryption, access control)
- Processing records (audit logs)
- Incident response procedures
- Data minimization

**SOC 2:**
- Documented security controls
- Access controls implemented
- Monitoring and logging
- Incident response plan
